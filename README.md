## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, Next, React-Chartjs, Tailwind

An administration interface that is created in react, when the administrator is logged in, he/she can add a new product or delete one of the existing products, also, a chart is shown in the interface so administrator can know how many items of each category are left, a custom API brings all the information of the products, like the user name and the password. To test the app you can log in with the user: admin@mail.com and the password: admin123.

## Optimizations

The UX and UI can be better, the site is not responsive.  

## Lessons Learned:

The use of chartjs to show specific categories or give another usage to this tool, the use of tailwind, acquire more knowledge about nextjs.
